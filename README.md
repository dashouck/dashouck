## Hi, I’m John Houck 👋

I’m a software engineer and artist. My journey spans from developing enterprise-level Java applications at Sun Microsystems/Oracle to creating data visualizations for IBM. Along the way, I’ve also built a remarkable career as a visual artist, with works featured in the permanent collections of institutions like MoMA, The Guggenheim, and SFMoMA.

Currently, I’m deepening my technical expertise by pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning at Georgia Tech.
